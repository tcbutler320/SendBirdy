About
-----

This is a fork of "python replacement for java.util.Properties" recipe on ASPN:
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/496795/ The project is maintained by Anand B Pillai

What this is
------------

This module is designed to be a python equivalent to the
``java.util.Properties <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html>``\ \_
class.

Currently, the basic input/output methods are supported.

Fundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse and manipulate Java Properties
files - that's it. There's a fair number of us pythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and
constantly writing your own parsing mechanism is just painful. Not to mention Java guys are
notoriously unwilling to use anything which is cross-language for configuration, unless it's XML,
which is a form of self-punishment. :)

Python support
--------------

The module is cross Python2 and Python3 compatible.

This module has basic support for Python3. It means the tests should pass under any version of
Python3 though it has been tested only for versions >= Python 3.6.6.

Due to the changes for Python3, this should work under any Python2 version >= Python 2.7.

Caveats
-------

The code still uses Python2 type strings inside. In other words proper unicode support is still
missing.

Plans
-----

Here is a plan for the current version which runs under Python2 in approximate decreasing priority
order.

1. Keep/maintain blank lines and comments found in the original file
2. Add unicode support
3. Provide python property access on top of direct dictionary get/set
4. Make the module compatible with the new methods in latest J2SE.

Usage
-----

::

        from pyjavaproperties import Properties
        p = Properties()
        p.load(open('test.properties'))
        p.list()
        print p
        print p.items()
        print p['name3']
        p['name3'] = 'changed = value'
        print p['name3']    
        p['new key'] = 'new value'
        p.store(open('test2.properties','w'))

See also the Properties.list() method, which will return an iterator over the property keys

Tests
-----

::

    $ python pyjavaproperties_test.py
